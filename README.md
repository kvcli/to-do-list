this is a # to-do-list using js.
you can enter your list items and after that click on the list item added to mark it as done. ( this is done using an eventListener which listens to your mouse clicking or to your keypress when you hit "Enter" on your keyboard).
When adding a list item, a delete button will be added next to each list item, and clrearly you can delete the list item whicn clicking that button. ( this is also done using event listener).
